## Code Usage

### Dependencies
- Pytorch 2.1.2
- IsaacGym Pr4

We recommend to install all the requirements through Conda by

    $ conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt -c pytorch -c conda-forge -c nvidia

IsaacGym Pr4 is available from the [official site](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym) and can be installed through `pip`.


### Policy Training

    $ python main.py <configure_file> --ckpt <checkpoint_dir>

We provide our configure files in `cfg` folder for reference. To reproduce the examples shown in the paper, e.g. `shoot`, please run the training by

    $ python main.py cfg/shoot.py --ckpt ckpt_shoot

The training results (model and log) will be generated in the `ckpt_shoot` folder.

The training can be done on a single GPU. Use `--device` option to specify the device used for training (default: 0).

### Evaluation

    $ python main.py <configure_file> --ckpt <checkpoint_dir> --test

We provide pretrained policy models in `pretrained` folder. To evaluate a pretrained policy, e.g. `shoot`, please run

    $ python main.py cfg/shoot.py --ckpt pretrained/shoot --test
